name=Banjo's Reusable/De-Weaponized Pens & Pencils
id=BanjoRDPAP
poster=poster.png
description=Makes all pens and pencils drainable (multi-use) items, but no longer allows them to be used as weapons (pencils can be sharpened and "re-weaponized" though). Also makes Crayons drainable, and all writing implements can now write notes/journals, too. Thanks to Kinyoshi and Oh God Spiders No for help. By Banjo.
